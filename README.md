# Netflix-Clone-Web-Using-React

A Netflix clone app using React, Redux, Firebase technology, and TMDB API would be a streaming application that mimics the functionality and design of Netflix and which is also a Responsive page. React would be used to create the user interface, while Redux would be used for state management. Firebase would provide backend services such as authentication, database, and storage.

The app would fetch movie and TV show data from the TMDB API, which would provide a vast library of content for the app. Users would be able to browse, search, and filter content by various criteria such as genre, rating, and release date.
